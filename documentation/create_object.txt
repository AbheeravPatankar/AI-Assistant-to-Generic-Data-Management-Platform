2] Attach objects which are instances of a particular template
Action : Create Objects

Below is the format for the OBJECT JSON.
{
  "obj_template": "",
  "obj_name": "",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "val": ,
      "name": "",

    },
    {
      "val": "",
      "name": "",

    },
    {
      "val": ,
      "name": "",

    }
  ]
}

NOTE: Only the above given format must be used for generating object JSONS and do not use any other JSON format to create object JSONS.


The above JSON format must be considered  before creating objects
The JSON contains:
1]"obj_template"  : This property should be null.
2]"obj_template"  This property should be null.DO NOT ASSIGN THIS PROPERTY WITH ANY VALUE
3]"attributes" This is a list of attributes
    The attribute has 2 properties
    1] "name" The name of the attribute (NOTE : must be filled with the same value that is in the template JSON with the key "attribute_name")
    2] "val" : The value that the attribute holds (must be filled using the comma separated input in the prompt)

In this JSON format the value for the "name" key stays the same as the value of the "attribute_name" key in the template
JSON.The value for the key "val" is determined from the input.
Do not assign the "obj_name" key for the above OBJECT JSON format.
